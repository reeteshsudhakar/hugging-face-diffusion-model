# Hugging Face Diffusion Model

I recently stumbled upon the image diffusion model released by Hugging Face. It's a spectacular model, and this repository is just a workspace to fiddle with it! 

I recommend using a virtual environment and a Jupyter Notebook to test out the model. You can find the requirements file in this repository, linked [here](https://github.com/reeteshsudhakar/hugging-face-diffusion-model/blob/main/requirements.txt).

Install the requirements into your virtual environment using the following command. 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Use `matplotlib` to display the images as needed. Happy exploring!
